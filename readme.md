# Purpose
To store beer monitoring KiCad files, other documentation, and code.

# Goal
To create a coin cell operated (good for at least 3 months) BLE temperature monitor for beer. It will be a 'beacon' that will send the temperature to a receiver (in my case will be Arduino MKR WiFi). This will allow the monitor to be on the lid and attached with a magnet.

## Secondary Goal
To learn enough about in-circuit programming and design to more easily pursue making battery powered grain temperature monitor.
